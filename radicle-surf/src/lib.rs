//! `radicle-surf` is a library to help users explore a Git repository with
//! ease. It supports browsing a repository via the concept of files and
//! directories, or via blobs and trees in a git fashion. With the additional
//! support of [`diff::Diff`] and [`History`], this library can be used to build
//! an intuitive UI for any Git repository.
//!
//! The main entry point of the library API is [`Repository`].
//!
//! Let's start surfing!
//!
//! ## Serialization with feature `serde`
//!
//! Many types in this crate support serialization using [`Serde`][serde]
//! through the `serde` feature flag for this crate.
//!
//! [serde]: https://crates.io/crates/serde
