A code surfing library for Git repositories üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Welcome to `radicle-surf`!

`radicle-surf` is a library to describe a Git repository as a file system. It
aims to provide an easy-to-use API to browse a repository via the concept of
files and directories for any given revision. It also allows the user to diff
any two different revisions.

One of the use cases would be to create a web GUI for interacting with a Git
repository (thinking GitHub, GitLab or similar systems).
